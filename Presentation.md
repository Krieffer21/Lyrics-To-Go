Process

Tasks and roles: 

For the tasks and roles we used the kanban board in git hub. (Demo the board). Joey was our main HTML and CSS guy. Jerry and Kaelyn took on the research on each of the apis and how to get the response from them. I took on the role of project manager and the structuring of the javascript file.  

Challenges: 

Finding the right api for our app. The lyric api we got in the first try. For the album one we had to switch it a couple of times till we found one that work. Learning and implementing git. Also making adjustments to our schedule outside the class.

Successes: 

We worked well as a team. Took time outside of class. When we hit a wall, we worked together to get passed it during class. Did a good amount of pare coding.

Future Development

Although our app, 'lyrics to go', is great in its current functionality, we would have liked to further its development, with some additional features while, maintaining its minimalistic styling. Some of these additional features would have included, adding a few buttons, such as:... 

    A share button, that would allow the user to share their findings directly to a friend or so they could post on social media.
    
    A suggestions button, that would reference the users prior search history to recommend other songs and artists to the user.
    
    A play button, that would display on the page after the user clicks the search button, giving the user the option to listen to the song while reading along with the lyrics. Or even having the lyrics scroll down as the song is playing, simmilar to karaoke.
    
    (lastly we would have liked to added) A search history button, that would allow the user to access a list of their previous searches. So in the event they wanted to revisit a song title and artist they previously searched for, the could simply look through their search history.
    
So with that said, for the future development of our app we would like to have added the buttons mentioned previously, to not only expand the users experience, but also their interaction with our app, 'lyrics to go'.
