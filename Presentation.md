Future Development

Although our app, lyrics to go, is great in its current functionality, we would like to further its development by some additional features while maintaining its minimalistic styling. Some of these additional features would include, adding a few buttons, a share button, suggestions button, a play song button, and button for the users search history. 
    The share button would allow the user to share their findings directly to a friend or post on social media.
    
    The suggestions button would use the users prior search history to recommend other songs and artists to the user.
    
    The play button would display on the page after the user clicks the search button, giving the user the option to listen to the song while reading along with the lyrics.
    
    The search history button would allow the user to access their previous searches. 
    
For the future development of our app we would like to have added the buttons mentioned previously to expand the users experience and interaction with lyrics to go.
