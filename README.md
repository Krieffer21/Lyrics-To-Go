# Project 1
  In this project we used our newly acquired full-stack skills and knowledge to build a web application from scratch. Working collaboratively as a team, we have executed our design by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Together we have learned the git branch workflow and pull requests. We have worked through several road blocks while executing our design and teamed up to slove more difficult bug fixes.

# Lyrics to Go
By: Jerry Forsberg, Joey Reyes, Yulia Tikhonova
  Our web application, 'Lyrics to Go' is designed to provide the user with album artwork and lyrics based on the artist and song title they search for. We have achived a streamline user interface with a minimalist design aesthetic leveraged sass and 'md' for bootstrap for intuitive interactivity. 
 
## Getting Album Artwork
  The code below checks if their is any error in retreaving information from the api (for the album artwork) and, if the user's input is invaild, by using an 'if' stament and the 'catch' function. If that is the case then the user will see our  error message and image on the page.
